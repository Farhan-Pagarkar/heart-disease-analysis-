# heart-disease-analysis-
This project focuses on analyzing health and medical data to assist in diagnosing heart disease. By leveraging machine learning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the aim is to identify key metrics, uncover meaningful patterns, and create a dashboard that visualizes relationships between critical attributes.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

age: Patient age in years
sex: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
cp: Chest pain type (categorical)
trestbps: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
chol: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
fbs: Fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dl, 1 = true, 0 = false)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (categorical)
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
thal: Thalassemia (categorical)
target: Diagnosis (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)
Features
ETL Process: Data cleaning, transformation, and loading for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distribution, visualizing correlations, and identifying critical factors.
Key Metric Identification: Highlighting significant features influencing heart disease diagnosis.
